- The developed code can be found in the folder "**./lab1/notebooks/**"
    * '**Fraud_detection_lab.ipynb**' contains the code for Task 1, 2, and 3.
    * '**Bonus.ipynb**' contains the code for the Bonus point.     
- The **.html rendered notebooks** can be found in the folder "**./lab1/notebooks/rendered/**"
- '**./lab1/report.pdf**' contains the LateX report for the assignment (we suggest you to read it before looking at the code to get a high-level understanding of what's going on there).
- Generated **images** which are also discussed in the report can be found in the folder "**./lab1/images/**"

Make sure your system has **Jupyter** installed, and run the notebook with a '**sudo**' command and '**--allow-root**' parameter to let the notebook install the required libraries. If you don't trust us, you can always install the dependencies manually by means of the 'pip' command (in this case, make sure you are installing the dependencies in the same environment which is used by Jupyter to run the notebook).      

If you do not know how to run a Jupyter notebook, then have a look at [THIS PAGE](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-jupyter-notebook-with-python-3-on-ubuntu-18-04).     

The "**./lab1/data/**" folder contains the '**zip**' file for the data. If you run the '**Fraud_detection_lab.ipynb**', it will unzip and extract it into a **.csv** file. Also, after the preprocessing section is ran, a **.csv** file with the processed data will be saved in the very same folder.   
     
**NOTE**: Some parts of the code might take a lot of time to run, but they are clearly marked in the notebook. If you don't have time to run them, or your machine takes too much time to do it, we provide the **rendered notebooks** with all the results in a **.html** format, so that you can read them anyway.    
        
**NOTE**: If you cannot run the code for whatever reason, you can download the processed file that we used to train/test the classifiers from [THIS LINK](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KfZFfqy0v1YjzFve52lHGAFcTbSWpxav)
